# metatron
Autonomous Power Racing Series Racecar - ROS Metapackage

## `gigatron_hardware`
The ROS wrapper code that interfaces with the Arduino lives here. So do sensor launch files and hardware config files.

## `gigatron`
Main race code. Could be cleaned up a bit more.

## `metatron` 
ISMETA* and or some reason this nested folder structure was required to make it a metapackage. Don't ask.

# Usage Instructions
Clone the entire metapackage into your catkin workspace. Run `catkin_make`.
