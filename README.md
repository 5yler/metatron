# metatron
Autonomous Power Racing Series Racecar - ROS Metapackage

## `gigatron_hardware`
The ROS wrapper code that I am going to write to interface with the Arduino will live here, we can also put sensor launch files here so `gigatron` doesn't get too cluttered.

## `gigatron`
Main race code. Could be cleaned up a bit.

## `metatron` 
ISMETA* and or some reason this nested folder structure was required to make it a metapackage. Don't ask.

# Usage Instructions
Clone the entire metapackage into your catkin workspace. Run `catkin_make`.
